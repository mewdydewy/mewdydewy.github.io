		You turn to look and it is your friend Zimmer dead asleep, leaning with his head arched over the back of his chair and snoring. 
		</p>
		<p>
		At that moment, everyone looked at poor, sleep-deprived Zimmer, and most people couldn't help but let out a laugh. Despite the uproar that he caused, Zimmer was still out cold.
		</p>

		<p>
		You look back at Mr. Poplar, and watch his blank expression slip into a devious smile - He has been waiting for this exact moment to prank your friend. With a dangerous look on his face, he walks over to his desk, opens a filing cabinet and takes out a small plastic bag. He proceeds to tear open the top of the package and hold up the contexts.
		</p>
		
		<p>
		Unfolding in Mr. Poplar's hand is a bald cap! He quickly holds it up, using both hands to tuck his mass of curly black hair underneath. Still smiling, he begins to walk sneakily over to Zimmer's desk in the center of the classroom. The room of 25 high schoolers has gone hushed.
		</p>
		
		<p>
		"To end class, my friends, we will look at the prime example of a parasitic relationship in this classroom ecosystem, where I am the instigator".
		</p>
		
		<p>
		Poplar's face becomes earnest as he bends over to Zimmer's height and gives him a gentle tap on the shoulder. Zimmer's eyes open up slightly as he awakes from deep slumber.

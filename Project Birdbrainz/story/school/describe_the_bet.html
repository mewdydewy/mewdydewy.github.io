		<p> You and Zimmer file out into the hallway, shoulder to shoulder with hundreds of other students. Thankfully, you have your friend, who towers above everyone else and has the build of a rottweiler. You watch as people conveniently part to get out of his way.</p>
		<p> Zimmer looks over his shoulder at you. “We’ll take bets,” he says “on what <i>Mistah Ray Augur</i> is doing when we get to the woodshop”. </p>
		<p> You both are heading in that direction, knowing that Ray was probably waiting for you and Zimmer before leaving for his place. The difference between Ray and Zimmer is that Ray will still be consumed in whatever he’s doing when you come to interrupt him, whereas Zimmer will make small talk, forever if you let him, with his teachers. Sometimes he even talks them into giving him a better grade, so it’s hard to call it unproductive.</p>
		<p> “My money is on him and Mr. Walsh being engaged in an interesting conversation about…” he pauses.</p>
		<p> “Poetry” ! he finishes. “$2.79 says it’s about haiku, or something literary. How about it?“ </p>

			<p> You wouldn’t be surprised if that’s what the two of them were doing. Mr. Walsh is a thought-provoking and eccentric teacher to say the least, and you know that Ray is in his woodworking and poetry class. Ray is quiet, but Mr. Walsh draws it out of him, and you know that he likes to write anyway, poetry or not. </p>
			<p> Then again, $2.79 IS enough for an energy drink at most places in town… </p>

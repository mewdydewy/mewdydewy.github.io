		"This is advanced biology, Mr. Cook, please try not to fall asleep" Poplar says gently.
		</p>
		<p>
		Zimmer blinks once. Then twice. Then he sees.
		</p>
		Your friend gasps and stammers "ah- AAA!". He kicks his feet to back away from the now-hairless Mr. Poplar, and tilts back in his chair just a little too far, starting on his descent downwards. With the thud of the hard plastic chair on the tiled floor and the defeated groan of your friend, the class is now in hysterics.
		<p>
		Shouting over the noise, Mr. Poplar is saying to the whole class "And that, Mr. Zimmer, illustrates parasitism, because I have disrupted your peaceful sleep and injured your dignity, and have gotten so much amusement out of it".
		</p>
		The bell rings, and people are only now packing up. Your friend has gotten himself up, still shaking himself awake and getting his things together with some effort.
		<p>
		"What did I miss while I was in the great beyond, Sir Poplar?" he manages to say with good humor.
		</p>
		Poplar is smiling. In a mystical and airy accent, he replies "You would do well to read up on page 161 of our textbook, my fine fellow. It has details on parasitism, everything from leeches to ghost pipes".
		<p>
		You stand next to Zimmer as he asks Poplar "What is a ghost pipe, sir?".
		</p>
		"Why, there are hundreds of them out in those woods over there. Don’t you walk that path to get home? They're the little white plants that look like bells and grow in great numbers after a good rain".
		<p>
		Incredulous, Zimmer says "I thought those were mushrooms, sir!".
		</p>
		<p>
		"Ah! Very good, most mushrooms parasitize plants, and not the other way around. 
		</p>
		<p>
		But ghost pipes? They sap nutrients from fungi… fungi that form in the roots of great trees and share nutrients, which is a…?"
		</p>
		<p>
		Zimmer is looking at him dumbfounded.
		</p>
		<p>
		"A mutualistic relationship! Go read up, Mr. Cook! Remember, our unit test is on the 27th, and I really want you to do well on your exam"
		</p>
		<p class = "choice">
		Mr. Poplar turns to you… "Our friend might need a little bit of your help studying, no?"

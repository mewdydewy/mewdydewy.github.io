		<p>The door to the shop opens, and you slip in after Zimmer. Depending on the day, the warm, incandescent bulbs drooping from the ceiling can make the room feel cramped or cozy. The dark brown of the walls helps the case for cozy, but it does make the room feel small as well. On the far side of the room, beyond the hanging lights, most of the heavy equipment and saws are lined up against a wall that is filled top-to-bottom with mural painting. The centerpiece is a faceless, grey humanoid’s torso: its features are expressionless, but it is wearing a white baseball hat and tee shirt, both covered in splashes of multi-colored paint. The figure is poised to strike, with a large paint roller in one hand and the other open to the viewer, and behind it is an explosion of color.</p>
		
		<p>In the center of the room are a series of six tables with locking wheels, with enough space to walk between them. Behind one of them, Mr. Walsh is engaged in conversation with Ray, but also a little girl who’s holding hands with -</p>
		
		<p>“Hey you two!” exclaims your friend Ari, sitting on top of a workbench holding onto their little sister, rocking the little one’s hands back and forth absent-mindedly. </p>
		
		<p>Zimmer is beaming. “Shouda figured you’d be here, too! Are you coming to Ray’s?” he asks.</p>
		
		<p> “I probably can’t stay very long,” they reply, hopping off of the bench, “but I’ll definitely walk home with you guys”.</p>
		
		<p>“Tell me, what were you guys just talking about before we walked in? Settle a bet for me” Zimmer says, and winks at you.</p>
		
		<p>“I only just got Lily from the pre-school wing, and still beat you bozos here!” Ari says. “No free period for me to woodwork today, but we were just telling Lily all about school for big kids, isn’t that right, dearie?”. Lily nods, and her blonde curls get messed up. Nothing at all like Ari’s wavy ginger mop, wherever that came from. </p>
		
		<p>“It wasn’t poetry, if that’s what you’re wondering, you son-of-a-bitch” Ray says smirking, looking up from his work.</p>
		
		<p> Zimmer starts “How did you - “.</p>
		
		<p>“Every damn day, Z. Every day…” Ray groans, still smirking “Do you think I don’t listen?“ </p>
		
		<p>Zimmer sighs, smiling, and after 20 seconds fishing through his pockets, he manages to pull out $2.85 in quarters and dimes. You stick your open hand out, and he acts like it’s a supreme effort to overcome his reluctance and give you the money.</p>
		
		<p>“Of course <i> you </i> didn’t stereotype me” Ray quips, still very much absorbed in a piece of paper taped to the surface of his workbench, presumably a draft.</p>

		<p> “I know I have to recruit my students early for carpentry,” says Mr. Walsh to the girl, “but you, my friend, are the youngest. Maybe one day you’ll follow in Ari’s footsteps”. </p>
		
		<p> The young girl contemplates it for a moment, smiles and shrugs. “Maybe!” she ventures. Mr. Walsh and Ari’s laughter fills the room. </p>
		
		<p> “Say, Ray, how’s your project coming along?” Zimmer inquires with a knowing smile. </p>
		
		<p> “Say, Zimmer, I think you all could have a look today if you were” Ray clears his throat “Up for a little afternoon stroll?”.  </p>
		
		<p> Could it be? You know Ray has been enlisting Ari’s help to build some structure in the woods for quite some time, although it’s been a while since the last time you saw it. </p>
		
		<p> Mr. Walsh is stroking his beard, “Ray’s capstone project, eh? Quite a marvelous design from the tech drawings, but the details are a mystery to me. Don’t forget to bring me a stick with the pictures on it, Ray”. </p>
		
		<p> “Yessir, gonna take the photos today! Ready, all?” Ray carefully rips his drawing from the table “Hell yeah! Let’s go”. </p>
		
		<p> With that, Ray turns around and goes to head out the back way, and Zimmer runs to catch up with him. </p>
		
		<p> “Come on, miss Lily” Ari says, gently grabbing their sister’s hand, “Time to go home!”. Ari starts taking large, goofy strides while swinging Lily’s hands, which the latter plays along with, laughing. </p>

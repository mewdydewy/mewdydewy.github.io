		<p>The door to the shop opens, and you slip in after Zimmer. Depending on the day, the warm, incandescent bulbs drooping from the ceiling can make the room feel cramped or cozy. The dark brown of the walls helps the case for cozy, but it does make the room feel small as well. On the far side of the room, beyond the hanging lights, most of the heavy equipment and saws are lined up against a wall that is filled top-to-bottom with mural painting. The centerpiece is a faceless, grey humanoid’s torso: its features are expressionless, but it is wearing a white baseball hat and tee shirt, both covered in splashes of multi-colored paint. The figure is poised to strike, with a large paint roller in one hand and the other open to the viewer, and behind it is an explosion of color.</p>
		
		<p>In the center of the room are a series of six tables with locking wheels, with enough space to walk between them. Behind one of them, Mr. Walsh is engaged in conversation with Ray, but also a little girl who’s holding hands with -</p>
		
		<p>“Hey you two!” exclaims your friend Ari, sitting on top of a workbench holding onto their little sister, rocking the little one’s hands back and forth absent-mindedly. </p>
		
		<p>Zimmer is beaming. “Shouda figured you’d be here, too! Are you coming to Ray’s?” he asks.</p>
		
		<p> “I probably can’t stay very long,” they reply, hopping off of the bench, “but I’ll definitely walk home with you guys”.</p>
		
		<p> “I only just got Lily from the pre-school wing, and still beat you bozos here!” Ari says. “No free period for me to woodwork today, but we were just telling Lily all about school for big kids, isn’t that right, dearie?”. Lily nods, and her blonde curls get messed up. Nothing at all like Ari’s wavy ginger mop, wherever that came from. </p>

		<p> “I know I have to recruit my students early for carpentry,” says Mr. Walsh to the girl, “but you, my friend, are the youngest. Maybe one day you’ll follow in Ari’s footsteps”. </p>
		
		<p> The young girl contemplates it for a moment, smiles and shrugs. “Maybe!” she ventures. Mr. Walsh and Ari’s laughter fills the room. </p>
		
		<p> “Say, Ray, how’s your project coming along?” Zimmer inquires with a knowing smile. </p>
		
		<p> “Say, Zimmer, I think you all could have a look today if you were” Ray clears his throat “Up for a little afternoon stroll?”.  </p>
		
		<p> Could it be? You know Ray has been enlisting Ari’s help to build some structure in the woods for quite some time, although it’s been a while since the last time you saw it. </p>
		
		<p> Mr. Walsh is stroking his beard, “Ray’s capstone project, eh? Quite a marvelous design from the tech drawings, but the details are a mystery to me. Don’t forget to bring me a stick with the pictures on it, Ray”. </p>
		
		<p> “Yessir, gonna take the photos today! Ready, all?” Ray carefully rips his drawing from the table “Hell yeah! Let’s go”. </p>
		
		<p> With that, Ray turns around and goes to head out the back way, and Zimmer runs to catch up with him. </p>
		
		<p> “Come on, miss Lily” Ari says, gently grabbing their sister’s hand, “Time to go home!”. Ari starts taking large, goofy strides while swinging Lily’s hands, which the latter plays along with, laughing. </p>

		<p> “Here we are! Let’s walk outside, my skin’s crawling in here” says Zimmer: two blue double-doors with tiny panes of glass mark the promised exit. </p>
		
		<p>Popping open the door, you're greeted by… a warm breeze. The promised field that awaited your eager eyes in the classroom is now before you.</p>
		<p>“Wowie” says your partner in crime, rolling up his sleeves.</p>
		<p>It’s one of those bizarre days in winter where the temperature is in the low 70s. Your shoes crunching as you brush the dead grass, it would be easy to forget that it wasn’t an August drought. You would have to ignore the snow melt getting your socks wet and the white sun glistening low in the western sky you’re walking towards, but it could still be Spring, at least.</p>
		<p>Only about 100 feet to your right stand the immense oaks along the edge of the woods you cut through on your way home. Not too many people come out this way unless they’re in carpentry, live on the other side, own a dirtbike, want to get freaky or are Mr. Poplar hunting for ghost pipes.</p>
		<p>“I suppose that’s why they call them ever-greens. I can’t believe I made it this far in life without realizing that…” Your friend remarks. </p>

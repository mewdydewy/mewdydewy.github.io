		<p> Resolved to action, you and your companions are heading back to the trail. </p>
		
		<p> “Ray’s cabin,” Ari says. “If there’s any indication of where he might be, it’s there” </p>
		
		<p> “I agree but shouldn’t we go back to his place for another look?” Zimmer questions. </p>
		
		<p> “We’ll cross that bridge when we get there…” is the reply. </p>
		
		<p> With snow covering the tops of branches and forming a hard layer of ice on the ground, the roads you know so well seem alien. There is light enough through the overcast sky that you can discern what is around you, but only with an uncomfortable squint past the reflective snow. The air around you is dimly lit in a void, only contrasting with the blue-grey of the clouds above. </p>
		
		<p> The walk to the clearing is quiet and reserved, unlike the constant banter of yesterday’s journey to Ray’s. There is a somber, yet purposeful morale among you all. Still, the silence reminds you of the awful gravity of the situation. </p>
		
		<p> Finally, you, Ari and Zimmer reach the top of the hill. </p>

			<p> “I’ll leave it up to you” Ari says. </p>
			<p> Zimmer nods, “Agreed”. </p>
			<p> “Shhh, I didn’t ask” Ari replies, winking at you and mustering the last of their good humor for such a remark. </p>

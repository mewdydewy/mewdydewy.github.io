		<p> Walking out through the double-doors with Zimmer, the world is as a sketch: you see rough hills of snow extending all across the grass field all the way past the edge of the forest, which appears as a densely-knotted bush with snow packed on top. </p>
		
		<p> Far off in the field, coming from the direction of the outbuilding, a dark, hooded figure is walking towards you and Zimmer at a brisk pace, and they're only getting quicker. </p>
		
		<p> "Who's that?" Zimmer asks you in a low voice. </p>

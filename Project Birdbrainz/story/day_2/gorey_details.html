		<p> It’s Ari. As they draw closer, you can see their expressionless face underneath their black hood. </p>
		
		<p> “Hey Ari,” Zimmer says tentatively. “What's up? Where’s Lily?” </p>
		
		<p> “They’re still looking after her at the school…” they begin, and then hesitate. “It’s Ray. I think he’s missing." </p>
		
		<br />
		
		<p> You both pause in disbelief. </p>
		
		<br />
		
		<p> “What - what makes you say that?” Zimmer manages to stammer. </p>
		
		<p> “I just checked with Mr. Walsh, and he's not in today. That's not all: I was supposed to go over his house yesterday, just for dinner with him and his mom,” Ari says, with surprising calm. “That morning, he stopped answering his phone. I’ve called him maybe twelve times since then, I even tried the landline…” she trails off, looking despondent.</p>
		
		<p> “And?...” Zimmer offers. </p>
		
		<p> “No one picked up, so I went to his house around 2” </p>
		
		<p> “What did you find?-” </p>
		
		<p> “The car parked in the driveway, no sign of anything happening to the house - no broken windows. The spare key was still in the gutter…” they spit out, and then pause, “But nobody there… I looked through every window and put my ear up to every door… it was silent”. </p>
		
		<p> And so are you and Zimmer, dumbfounded. Ari has been looking at their feet, talking as if you weren’t actually there. They look up directly at you, with mad, fervorous eyes and walk closer. </p>
		
		<p> “But then I heard something strange”, they say in a low, shaky voice, turning between you and Zimmer. “It was terrible, yet…" </p>
		
		<p> Another pause. They look at their feet again, look at Zimmer weakly, and start shaking their head. Zimmer seems overwhelmed. </p>

		<p> You feel a slimy tendril wrap around your leg.Now you and Ari are both being dragged back across the snow by the terrible husk of your friend's mom! </p>
		<p> Struggle as you may, you cannot rend yourself free from the bonds of the ropelike tentacles. </p>
		<p> You witness as a valiant Zimmer picks up a large branch and hurls it at the hideous satire of Ms. Augur. The log arcs towards you and you hope that it will sever you free. Alas, Ms. A simply dodges out of the way. Before you know it, the creature tosses an immobilized Ari off to the side. </p>
		<p> You hear Zimmer shout your name, whatever it may be, in the space of  your dying breath, as a cold, dagger-like needle impales you through the heart and pumps your bloodstream full of delicious spores. </p>
		
		<p> to clarify: there is no afterlife</p>

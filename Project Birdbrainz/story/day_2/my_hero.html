		<p> You dash over to Ari and shove them out of the way, getting grabbed by the tentacles in the process. With uncanny speed, you are being dragged away from your companions and towards a horrible fate. </p>
		<p> Your panic reaches its falsetto right as you hear a heroic grunt as Ari slashes the tendrils off of you with a bowie knife. Where they got it, you have no idea. </p>
		<p> The terrible sounds of Ms. Augur's agonizing, human screams are painful to bear, but it seems that the parody of your friend's mom is backing off, and that gives you and your two friends the chance to escape. </p>
		<p> The three of you run back to the clearing (being sure to avoid taking any rights) and swing around to the wide trail that feeds directly into the straightaway. You continue to high-tail in the opposite direction from where you just came until you find the narrow, snow-covered path back to the road near your house, just down the street from Ray. Never before had you been so grateful to get out of those woods. </p>
		
		<p> "This is not all bad!" Zimmer says, sounding delirious </p>
		<p> "How do you imagine that - ", Ari asks, ending their remark a very derogatory term.</p>
		<p> "Listen," Zimmer continues, "Why would Ms. Zombie Augur be over there so close to the cabin unless Ray were still alive somewhere nearby?"
		<p> "Parts of this are still unsolved, though. What happened to Ray's dog? Is Ray's mom actually a zombie? Can she be cured?"</p>
		<p> I still think we can learn something if we go back to Ray's house... let's start there, and check the cabin as soon as we possibly can. </p>
		
		<p> But there is little time to prepare, because you can already see the small, green home from where you are </p>

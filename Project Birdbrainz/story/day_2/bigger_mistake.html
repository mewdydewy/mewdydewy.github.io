		<p> The crunching of your shoes seems to be extraordinarily loud at the moment. The wind that was blowing at your back seems to have ceased and, as you tread closer, the words are crisp in the air. </p>
		
		<p> </i> “For the things you do, endear you to me, oh… you know I will” </i> </p>
		
		<p> She is facing the trail ahead of her, away from you all. You do not take your eyes off of her as you go around the bend that separates you from the person that you have been looking for. </p>
		
		<p> “Ms. A?... Ms. A?” Ari calls out from next to you, on your left. </p>
		
		<p> “Oh, my dear!” Ms. A replies in a soft and airy voice. “I’m sorry that I didn’t hear you sooner, I don’t know what’s gotten into me”. She seems almost absent-minded, still looking away from you all. </p>
		
		<p> “You’re barely dressed for the cold, Ms. Augur,” Zimmer says with concern, moving closer on your right as he talks, before stopping again. His hand is outstretched, and his face is stricken with horror. “Dear God, look at how pale you are! We need to get you inside. How long have you been out here?”.  </p>
		
		<p> Ms. Augur’s usual coloration, indicative of her health and vigor, seems entirely tapped. </p>
		
		<p> “Oh don’t worry about me, sweetheart, the cold doesn’t bother me…” she says, turning toward him. </p>
		
		<p> <i> “Not anymore…”</i> </p>
		
		<div class = "important">
			<p> Two plucked-out eye sockets aim their gaze at you and your friends as a face that might have been Ms. Augur’s smiles at you. Two messes of weblike tendrils weave their way out of her head, like the feeling antennae of an insect. </p>
			
			<p> "Don't worry, my dears… soon you won't be bothered, either," Ms. Augur says. </p>

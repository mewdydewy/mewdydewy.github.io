		<p> Descending to the shortcut, you remember that these are very unfriendly looking trees - they have dark scars on their bark that look like eyes looking back at you, and ever-branching, dendritic limbs that seem to tessellate on and on forever. They are so densely-packed that, even without any foliage, they blot out the sun. You are reminded of the horrible man-eating spiders crawling around in the literary Mirkwood… </p>
		
		<p> Then again, perhaps the trees aren’t so bad after all. With the gentle snowfall landing on the fingerlike branches, they appear to be penciled into a drawing. </p>
		
		<p> The crunching of Zimmer’s shoes ceases as he stops suddenly, and gestures to you to do the same. Through the disturbances of a slight wind, you strain your hearing, but then… </p>

			<p> <i> Your song will fill the air </i> </p>

		<p> You hear the gentle singing, somewhere not far from you. With the whistling air carrying the sound in all directions, it is hard to discern just how close it might be </p>
		
		<p> “Look!” Ari says, pointing towards a gap between two pale, barkless trees. Clear as day, a pale figure is sitting on a stump by the trail, in a black suit against the bleak white of its surroundings. You are certain that your eyes deceive you if that figure is not Ms. Augur.</p>
		
		<p> “ <i> Sing it loud so I can hear you</i> ,” the figure sings, looking upward. She continues, but you cannot quite make it out. </p>
		
		<p> “This is it… this is what I heard” Ari says. </p>

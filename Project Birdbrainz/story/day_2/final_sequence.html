		<p> You and your two companions scamper across the way to the cabin, open the makeshift door and peer inside. </p>
		<p> You are more than relieved to see your unfortunate friend cowering in a dark corner, who is even more relieved than that to see you. </p>
		<p> Crouched in the corner of Ray’s cabin where the damp earth meets wood, you watch the small window facing the railbed. The sound of the wind rustling the cabin is all that interrupts the silence until </p>

		<p>The pressure of the air itself is dropping drastically, and the low whistle of the wind seems now a dissonant hum. Still the footsteps approach…</p>

		<p>There in the window’s view, head upright and facing forward, is a true parody of Ray’s mom. Her complexion is moon-pale and without coloration, much unlike her usual rosy self, with a fixed and uncanny smile that conveys no happiness. Her usually graceful movements have been replaced by the unchanging rigidness of a brisk stride. </p>
		<p>Just like that, she is gone, and you wait beside Ray as her footsteps slowly die off.</p>
		<p>Once you're sure that Ms. Augur is no longer around, you give the signal, and the four of you pop out of the cabin and run back out of the woods as fast as your feet will take you. The rescue mission is complete: you have saved Mr. Ray Augur.</p>
		<p>Is all well and good? You can be absolutely sure it is not. But your friend is alive, if unwell. Congratulations!</p>
		<p> Now go kill Ms. A.</p>

		<p> No I'm just kidding - congratulations, this is the good ending. You've done very admirably indeed.</p>

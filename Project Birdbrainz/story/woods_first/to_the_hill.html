		<p> The forest floor is mostly grassy and dotted in debris like dead leaves and acorns. It isn't too muddy today on the trail, but you have to watch your step. </p>
		
		<p> “So Walsh knows about your project?” Zimmer inquires, stepping over a small bunny hill. </p>
		
		<p> “Knows about it?” Ray asks smiling, raising an eyebrow at Zimmer “He’s my sponsor! It’s fantastic, he gives me most of the supplies and tools I need, and doesn’t ask many questions. He wants the pictures mostly because he’s curious, and maybe to give me a grade for it as a ‘capstone project’ ”. </p>
		
		<p> The path starts to bend left around a large tree and its branch that hangs over. Ari walks over, jumps to grab it and swings on it, turning back around to face Zimmer.  </p>
		
		<p> “Ostensibly, the class is working on the garden back there. Ray and I’s skills would be wasted, though, if we didn’t apply them to something more… whimsical”. </p>
		
		<p> Lily looks up at Ari and raises her hands, clasping them a few times. “Use your words, dearie!” Ari suggests. </p>
		
		<p> “Pick me up!” she replies eagerly, and with a deep “ARRGH” Ari swoops down and throws her atop their shoulders. The little one is in hysterics.  </p>
		
		<p> The path starts to straighten out again, and the trees start to grow taller. On the left, birches and other deciduous trees are scattered along the shores of a large marsh, filled with golden-brown reeds. This time of day, the reeds reflect the light of the setting sun. You look up, and the sky is still deep blue, the clouds having mostly dissipated. </p>
		
		<p> On the right are little pine tree saplings and bushes, basking in the brief illumination. A sea of dead leaves surround their bases, and the occasional log strewn across the landscape surfaces from the deep. These giants were taken out by storms after, perhaps, many years of being dead. </p>
		
		<p> You are surrounded by the intermittent shadows of the forest on your left. Up ahead, though, you see light poking through the sky quite easily: it is the clearing, and the tall hill that marks its centerpiece. The dirt you walk in starts to lighten in color as it becomes looser, and grass reclaims more and more of the landscape.</p>
		
		<p> Ray lets out a really deep breath. “Breath-taking”, he says. </p>
		
		<p> “Pffbbt, Clearly!” says Ari, and they and Zimmer both laugh. Ray laughs, too, shaking his head. </p>

		<p> As you all start towards the entrance to the woods, Zimmer’s feet shuffle like crazy. You hear him start at Ray, “How’s that little” before clearing his throat dramatically and continuing “side hustle of you and Mr. Walsh’s going?”. </p>
		
		<p> “Come on now,” is the reply. </p>
		
		<p> “You come on! We both know Mr. Walsh. What do you think he’s gonna be growing? Onions?? Eh??” Zimmer lampoons, nudging Ray’s shoulder as he laughs. “Don’t tell me you don’t know for a fact that he’s smoking ganja out in these here woods, and wants you to help with his little on-campus grow-op”. </p>
		
		<p> “Alright, alright, alright, alright” Ray says with a smile. “So maybe he teaches poetry and creative writing and maybe inhales a little too much sawdust every day - sure. But just because he has me building a composter” he comments waving the tech drawing in his hand “doesn’t mean that his head is so… fried that he doesn’t realize that someone will notice if he tries to grow some grass”. </p>
		
		<p> “No, no, no… c’mon,” Zimmer says, wrapping a shoulder around his pal as they both slow down, dropping his voice low “You think anyone comes by here that actually gives a damn? Move the planter box a little further into the woods and he’s smooth sailing, he could make it until retirement before someone notices”. At that absurd thought, Ray is cackling. Mr. Walsh was 40 or so at most, and barely had any grey hairs. </p>
		
		<p> “Inseparable, aren’t they?” Ari says not too quietly to you. They inhale in momentary surprise, “Lily, don’t repeat anything they just said, y’hear?” </p>
		
		<p> You all have now reached the treeline- before you, the green grass is tempered by brown leaves littered across the ground, and the spiraling lichen-covered oaks, reaching for what remains of the sun’s light. </p>

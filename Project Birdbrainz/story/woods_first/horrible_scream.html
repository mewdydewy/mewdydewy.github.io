		<p> Unable to resist the temptation, you put the ears above Zimmer’s head as Ray snaps the photo. He smiles at you and says, “Excellent”. </p>
		
		<p> From the shack, Ray’s house is mostly visible. Another couple hundred feet on the main drag, and it’s trivial to cut through a few bushes and saplings to step right into Ray’s backyard. </p>
		
		<p> The first thing you see of the small, white and green house is the back porch that faces the woods, and the several glass window panes that let one look out from the outside in and vice versa. As you walk across the patchy and unkempt grass of Ray’s yard, you start to discern a large English bulldog waiting patiently for its owner. </p>
		
		<p> Before you can reach the door, however, Lily lets out a horrible scream. </p>

		<p> The path winds straddling two groves of thin, black pines on either side. Ray once pointed out that it reminded him of how he imagined Mirkwood in <i> The Hobbit. </i> </p>
		
		<p> Tire tracks in the kicked-up dirt indicate the presence of dirtbikers, although you havenâ€™t heard the characteristic motors yet. Looking down at Lily smiling as they look up at the treetops, you remember what it was like to be enchanted by this fascinating ecosystem as a young'n. Being that she was Ari's little sister, you can be almost certain that <i> The Hobbit </i> has been read to her. </p>
		
		<p> "There are many forks in the dirtbike trails, but staying true to the way to Ray's follows an easy pattern" Ari says to you. "Never take the first left, always, take the second left. After that, no more turning. Watch, we'll stay straight here and end up just where we want to be". </p>
		
		<p> [Rule #1 of walking through the woods: always stick with Ari if you don't want to get lost.] </p>
		
		<p> The trees have started to thin out again, although the roots that split through the coating of dried-out, orange pine needles are still treacherous. In front of you lies an interesting formation. A banked slope, and as far as you can see on either side, a straightaway. </p>

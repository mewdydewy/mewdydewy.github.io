		<p> Ari shouts an expletive at the sight of something on the ground, while Lily is crying. You walk over to investigate, and see what remains of a woodpecker. </p>
		
		<p> “I’m so sorry”, Ray starts, apologizing profusely. “Napoleon must have gotten to the poor critter”. Napoleon is the dog. </p>
		
		<p> “Shhhh, shhhhh, it’s okay sweetie. The little birdie must have been really, really old” Ari is telling Lily to console her, looking hopelessly at Ray. </p>
		
		<p> “I feel bad for Napoleon if he did get to that thing” Zimmer tells Ray, “Look at the head”. </p>
		
		<p> The head, severed from the rest of the body, seems to be hollowed out already. All that’s left are bones, feathers, the chalky remains of yellow, sinewy connective tissue and two empty eye sockets. From these eye sockets, however, some white sacs appear to be propagating. </p>
		
		<p> Zimmer drops his voice, "If he did get to it, then he must've spat most of it back out, at least". </p>
		
		<p> As Ari and Ray guide Lily inside, your mind remains on the sight of the dead bird itself. You can only imagine how such a thing must have appeared to an innocent young’n like Lily. </p>

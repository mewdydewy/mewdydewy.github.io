		<p> Ari bolts, giving you barely any time to react. You forgot how fast they were! </p>
		
		<p> Despite your valiant effort, Ari turns around to fall on their backpack before you reach the summit. They pant, trying to catch their breath, half-laughing. </p>
		
		<br / >
		
		<p> Looking up, the sky seems like a massive empty disc of blue, with a bright halo of sunlight encompassing it in all directions. There actually was a little bit of wind blowing on your face up here: finally, the sense of freedom you were looking for. Ray, holding Lily’s hand, and Zimmer ascend the slope themselves, the latter sitting down and putting their bag between their legs, the former opting to stand. </p>
		
		<p> “You can see all around, up here” Ray muses, and turns to face somewhere northwest, judging by the sun. “Over that way is that weird valley… oh yeah! Check out that huge rift in the trees”. Turning more to the north, he pointed “and then Ari and I’s houses should be that way”. </p>
		
		<p> Zimmer is looking over his shoulder, northeast, “that way to the river proper, over on our side of the neighborhood” he adds, gesturing to you. </p>
		
		<p> He looks over you and Ari’s stretched bodies towards the east. “Say, Ari…” </p>
		
		<p> “Mmm” they grunt in reply. </p>
		
		<p> “If I were to take that rightmost path here eastward to those highlands over there, where might I end up?” </p>
		
		<p> “Dead” they say flatly. “Nah, just kidding”. They sit up to get a better look. “Hmmm… ah yes! I remember, now. There’s a lake over that way where a lot of the eastern river empties, and a little shore. We’ve skipped rocks there, definitely. Right Ray?” </p>
		
		<p> “Certainly” he says, and sighs, “but I wouldn’t go swimming there. Place gives me the creeps, and I heard there’s a monster in the lake that” he goes to grab Ray “eats athletes!”. </p>
		
		<p> “Ah, you son of a gun!” Zimmer exclaims and grabs Ray around the torso. Ray gasps, and soon enough, both of them hit the ground.  </p>
		
		<p> “Fight!” Lily hollers. </p>
		
		<p> “Agreed! Entertain us!” Ari says. </p>
		
		<p> After wrestling for a moment, Ray gets up with his curly hair in a mess and his glasses all askew. Both he and Zimmer were covered in dirt. </p>
		
		<p> “Well, uh… shall we get going?” Zimmer inquires. </p>
		
		<p> Clearing his throat, Ray replies “Yeah, let’s keep going”. Facing west, the sun is finally approaching the horizon, as a clear orange stain surrounds the yellow-white orb. “Actually” Ray says, and kneels to poke through his bag. “Here we go,” he says, grabbing the promised camera and pointing it towards the setting sun. Click. </p>
		
		<p> “We’ll take that group photo by the shack, yeah?” he offers. </p>
		
		<p> “Why, yes, of course!” Zimmer says in his mystical fantasy voice. “Which way whither we wander, O Wise Augur? Shall we take the scenic route or the short-cut?” </p>
		
		<p> "Let us cut short the trip, O Zimmer the Zealous" Ray shouts, matching Zimmer's insanity, "If you two shall take the woods home, you shall have your fill of that path ere long!" </p>
		
		<p> With that, Ray descends the back-side of the hill. Now, Lily is holding onto your arm. </p>

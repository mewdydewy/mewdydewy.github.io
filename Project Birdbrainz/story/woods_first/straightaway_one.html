		<p> The straightaway, which runs for miles past Ray’s house, was once an old railbed. With the trail around here being so well-traveled, much of the evidence is gone: spikes have been torn up, tracks and lumber have been removed or repurposed. Whatever is left sleeps submerged under streams, buried underground, covered by moss, or otherwise quietly rots off to the side of the path. </p>
		
		<p> Momentarily, you try to discern what could possibly be at the end of the trail, while the forest in your peripheral vision stretches out. Your eyes focus on the trees in the far distance. As you lose that focus, all of your surroundings come rushing back to you. </p>
		
		<p> Zimmer is tugging on your shoulder, “You alright, boss? You’ve barely taken notice”. </p>
		
		<p> There, less than 200 feet away from the weaving paths you just left, was the undecorated exterior of Ray and Ari’s magnum opus. The walls, probably provided by Mr. Walsh, were simply wrapped-up plywood. The structure itself was a small distance from the straightaway, but it had a decent gap in the front face for a window that looked upon it. </p>
		
		<p> “I had to get creative with the beams…” Ray comments, smiling from ear to ear at you, proud of his creation. “Come on, now, let’s have a closer look”. </p>
		
		<p> Upon closer inspection, the beams certainly are creative: you’re pretty sure they’re - </p>
		
		<p> “From the great heap of railbed wood over by his real house” Ari mentions, finishing your thought. “Neat, huh? The roof right now is just a tarp covering a coupla thin slabs of wood, but there’d have to be a lot of snow to bring it down”. They pause, somewhat expectantly, before saying "No, please! Save your 'oohs and ahhs' for later". </p>
		
		<p> "No, no, no," Zimmer says, smiling in embarrassment, "I think it's really cool, promise". </p>
		
		<p> “Just go stand in front of it, you clowns!” Ray hollers. “Yes, you too, little Lily!”. He slings his back around his front, and grabs the camera. Ari sneaks in between you and Zimmer, who grabs hold of Lily while Ari leans back and tries to bring everyone with them. <span class = "woodsChoice"> A thought comes to your mind. </span> </p>

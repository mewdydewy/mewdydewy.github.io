		<p> A few hours after that minor spook, the mood is much lighter inside Ray's home. </p>
		
		<p> When you had first come in through the small patio where you saw Napoleon, Ms. Augur and Ari immediately started to comfort Lily as she dropped to the floor. </p>
		
		<p> "When a bird dies, their spirit gets to fly even higher than it did in life" Ray's mom said, one hand holding the young one, and the other rising upwards, waving. "Think about how free the bird is, especially now after it has left its body". These words got Lily to stop crying. In fact, the little one even seemed happy. </p>
		
		<p> "Did you ever hear the song before, Lily?" Ray's mom asks thoughtfully. She recited the tune clapping Lily's hands together. </p>
		
		<br />
		<div class = "song"> 
			<p> <i> Blackbird singin in the dead of night </i> </p>
			
			<p> <i> Take these broken wings and learn to fly </i> </p>
			
			<p> <i> All your life </i> </p>
			
			<p> <i> You were only waiting for this moment to arise </i> </p>
		
		</div>
		
		<br />
		
		<p> At this, Lily was able to stand up all on her own </p>
		
		<p> Ari, about as serious as you'd ever seen them, had stopped Ray's mom. "You're an angel," they said emphatically. </p>
		
		<p> "Anytime, my dear…" Ray's mom said, smiling. "When Ray was little, he would mourn every squashed bug". </p>
		
		<p> "Come on now, ma" Ray said, although his smile, too, betrayed him. It was obvious where he got his sensitivity, although you don't know too much about his dad. </p>
		
		<br />
		
		
		<p> Now, Ms. Augur has abandoned the suit jacket she still had on when you saw her, retiring it to hang on the back of the chair you're sitting at, and has rolled up the sleeves on her white button-up. After fixing the little one a bowl of soup, Ms. Augur rustles her curly blonde locks, and kisses her on the head. </p>
		
		<p> "Are you feeling better, my dear?" she inquires tenderly. </p>
		
		<p> "Mmmmm," Lily replies. "This soup is yummy, Ms. Augur!". Her and Ray's bulldog, who is content to sit with his legs spread out and his belly on the cold hardwood floor, have even warmed up to each other. </p>
		
		<p> "It's the Augur family recipe!" is the reply, as Ms. Augur is walking back across the room. </p>
		
		<p> From what you know there are mushrooms, bell peppers, onions and garlic cloves. Upon first seeing this combination, you were appalled, but upon first tasting it, you were shocked - not at how bad it was, but how tasty. </p>
		
		<p> You are seated across from the little girl, with your own bowl in front of you on the light brown dinner table. The walls in Ray's kitchen are painted a cozy sort of orange-yellow, complemented by the warm light above the stove, on the other side Ray and Ari are still in Ray's room in the hallway behind you playing Mario Kart, while Zimmer and Ms. Augur are scooping broth from the pot on the stove, talking. </p>
		
		<p> "So what's the secret, Ms. A? How do you make it so good?" </p>
		
		<p> "If I told you" Ms. Augur starts sweetly, "I'd have to chop you up into little pieces and feed you to the dog" </p>
		
		<p> You see momentary shock in Zimmer's face before he laughs, albeit a little nervously, before Ms. Augur joins in. You watch as Napoleon scampers back onto the patio. "Arggh, you bastard!" you hear a familiar voice holler, and Ari walks out the door to Ray's room, looking over their shoulder at Ray himself, who walks out mocking them with a yawn and his hands behind his back. Ari is revitalized however, when they see that it's - </p>
		
		<p> "Soup time!" they shout, "Thank you, Ms. A!" </p>
		
		<p> "Yes, thank you ma!" Ray pitches in. </p>
		
		<p> Ms. Augur tilts her head, "My pleasure, sweethearts… Oh Ray, honey, I'm gonna get the chow for Napoleon, I'll be gone just a second". With that, Ms. A disappears back through the door to the patio, where Napoleon's bowl and all the dog food are. </p>
		
		<p> "Son-of-a-bitch!" you hear from the patio. </p>
		
		<p> "Ms. Augur?!" Zimmer asks incredulously, whipping around and walking towards the disturbance. </p>

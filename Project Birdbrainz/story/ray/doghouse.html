		<p> Ms. Augur is dragging Napoleon out the door, "You're in the doghouse tonight, buster!" she shouts, casting him out and slamming it shut behind him. </p>
		
		<p> "Are you alright, mom?" Ray says, moving towards her. </p>
		
		<p> At that moment, she displays her forearm to reveal a few small trickles of blood where the beloved bulldog had sunken a few teeth into her arm. "Not to worry, I'll go wash it off" she pauses, examining it, and then turns to you all "Thank you for your concern, though, dears". With that, she walks past you and into the kitchen, and you hear the faucet running. </p>
		
		<p> Ray's brows come together, deep in thought. "I can't believe he did that," he says, somewhat upset, "He hasn't done anything like that since he was a puppy". </p>
		
		<p> "Let's take your mind off it, eh?" Ari begins, and wraps their arm around Ray's shoulders. </p>
		
		<p> Zimmer walks up to him and does the same, with a hearty slap, "Yeah!". Turning to Ari across Ray's body, he suggests "Night of the Living Dead?" </p>
		
		<p> "A classic suggestion from Zimmer! I didn't know you were so cultured??!" Ari shouts, incredulous. </p>
		
		<p> This did something to lighten the mood, especially given Ms. Augur's laughter over the running water. As you pass by her going to Ray's room, his mom is applying a cotton ball to her arm, presumably soaked in hydrogen peroxide. </p>
		
		<p> "Are you sure you're okay?" Zimmer asks tentatively. Ray is looking on at his mother, still perplexed. </p>
		
		<p> "Yes! Yes! I'm fine, kids…" she says, turning to face you all. "Go watch that movie! I can take care of myself…". She turns around to look at you all, and smiles reassuringly. </p>
		
		<p> "Oh shoot!" Ari says aloud, looking at their watch, "I had no idea it had gotten so late. On second thought, I  have to take Lily home… I don't think George A. Romero would do her any good tonight, anyways". </p>
		
		<p> "9 O'clock already??!" Zimmer exclaims. He turns to you, "Maybe we should head out as well". </p>
		
		<p> "Oh, in that case, let me walk you all out" Ray says with kind eyes. </p>

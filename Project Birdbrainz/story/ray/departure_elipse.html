		<p> "See y'all tomorrow or Sunday, maybe?" </p>
		
		<p> "You can count on it!" Ari says, and gives a little salute. </p>
		
		<p> Approaching the busted-up, grey street, you watch as Lily rubs her eyes with a hand. </p>
		
		<p> "Don't worry, dearie!" Ari is saying happily, "We'll be home in 10 minutes, tops!". </p>
		
		<p> Their sister responds with a yawn. To this, Ari says "Alright, up you go!" and picks her up to carry again. </p>
		
		<p> "Nighty-night, sleepy lady," Zimmer says to the young girl, who has almost already passed out. </p>
		
		<p> Ari is beginning to veer left, and says "See you guys very soon, and have a good one". </p>
		
		<p> "Cheers, you too!" Zimmer replies, staying right and waving from afar. "Good night!". </p>
		
		<p> Walking off to the side of the road on bits of broken asphalt and loose dirt, you reflect on the day's events with your companion. </p>

		<p> "Ray would laugh at me for being superstitious, but it feels like a bad omen," Zimmer muses. "Perhaps I'm trying to find meaning where there is none, but I can't shake the feeling that all that happened tonight was related somehowâ€¦". </p>
		
		<p> This bizarre thought resonates in your mind as you try to close your eyes and fall asleep. </p>
